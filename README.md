# FinalProject
Michela Marchini and Stephanie Zheng's Final Project

Our project is an inventory management system that can keep track of a buisness's inventory and profit. Each "buisness" has its own account that can be created and holds all previous transactions of the account.

Features to test:
-Creating a new account
-Loging into a pre-existing account (and having all the info saved)
-Adding a new product to inventory
-Removing a product from the inventory
-Making a sale
-Restocking an item
-Profit and quantity auto-update after a sale/restock

Unresolved bugs:
If you put an invalid type input (letters instead of numbers) in more than one field, the code breaks. The program still continues to run but the code won't do anything. (didn't know how to prevent that)

How to compile and run:
Compile and run SignUp.java to create a new account when you start and you will be automatically directed to login. After you have an account, if you close the program and want to log back in compile and run Login.java.

How to use:
Everything is labeled with what you should enter where. Your updated inventory will be printed in the terminal whenever you try to do an action.
